## Lesson 01 - Big Data 

### 1. Definition of Big Data 

Big Data is a loosely defined term used to describe data sets so large and complex that they become awkward to work with using standard statistical software. (International Journal of Internet Science, 2012, 7 (1), 1â€“5)

### 2. Challenges of Big Data 

* Data is created very fast.
* Data comes from various sources. 
* Data comes in with various formats. 

### 3. [3Vs Data Management](https://blogs.gartner.com/doug-laney/files/2012/01/ad949-3D-Data-Management-Controlling-Data-Volume-Velocity-and-Variety.pdf)

* Volumns: size of data
  * cheaper way of storing data reliably
  * also relates to stream through networks and read/process data
  * __Hadoop__ stores massive data in a distributed way across multiple machines. 
* Variety: diff sources + diff formats
  * Relational Databases: SQL Server, MySQL
  * Data Warehouses from Oracle and IBM
  * Unstructured & Semi-structured data 
  * __Hadoop__ accepts all formats of data 
* Velocity: speed of data arrived & the speed of processing data
  * avoid discarding data 
  * more data == more useful/insightful info
